Welcome to the **Telco Customer Churn Analysis & Predictive Model** project! This Jupyter Notebook project explores customer churn data from a fictional telecommunications company serving 7,043 customers in California during Q3. We not only perform extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) but also build and evaluate predictive models to forecast both customer churn and churn reasons.

## Introduction

This project analyzes customer churn for a telco company that provided home phone and Internet services. Using a dataset of 7,043 customers and 33 variables, we delve into key questions:

- What are the main reasons for subscription cancellations?
- When do most churn events occur?
- How do billing factors and contract types influence churn?
- Can we predict churn and the specific churn reason with high accuracy?

The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as **pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scipy,** and **statsmodels**.

---

## Data Overview

The dataset, **Telco_customer_churn.xlsx**, includes detailed customer information such as demographics, service usage, billing details, and churn indicators (e.g., Churn Label, Churn Value, Churn Score, CLTV, and Churn Reason). Data cleaning steps involved dropping irrelevant columns, converting data types, and handling missing values to prepare for analysis.

---

## Exploratory Analysis

Key EDA steps include:
- Visualizing missing data with heatmaps.
- Examining distributions via histograms and scatter plots.
- Computing correlation matrices to identify relationships among variables (e.g., Tenure Months, Monthly Charges, Total Charges, and CLTV).
- Performing chi-square tests and ANOVA to assess the significance of relationships between churn factors.

These analyses revealed:
- Most churn occurs in the first month.
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.
- Strong correlations exist between tenure, total charges, and CLTV, with monthly charges also playing a role.

## Predictive Modeling

### Model Development

We extended our analysis by developing predictive models that:
1. **Predict whether a customer will churn**  
2. **Predict the churn reason**

Using techniques like label encoding and feature scaling, we evaluated three models:
- **Decision Tree**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**

### Results

- **Random Forest** emerged as the best model, achieving the highest test accuracy in both churn classification and churn reason prediction.
- Confusion matrices and performance metrics demonstrate the modelâ€™s robustness and potential for real-world application.

### Sample Predictions

We also tested the model on simulated new customer data, generating predictions for churn and corresponding churn reasons (e.g., *Service Quality*, *Price*, *Competitor*, *Other*).

---

## Conclusions

- **Churn Drivers:** Major reasons for churn include poor support, competitive offers, low download speeds, and insufficient data.
- **Timing:** The majority of churn occurs within the first month of service.
- **Billing Impact:** While monthly charges show a statistically significant relationship with subscription duration, they explain only a modest portion of the variance.
- **Contract Influence:** Month-to-month contracts experience the highest churn, whereas one- and two-year contracts demonstrate stability.
- **Predictive Success:** Incorporating a predictive model using Random Forest transforms the analysis into a practical decision support toolâ€”empowering telecom companies to proactively address churn by tailoring interventions based on predicted churn reasons.

## Further Research

Future directions include:
1. **Advanced Predictive Modeling:**  
   - Enhance the model with additional features (e.g., customer service interactions, feedback) and integrate it into a real-time decision-support system.
2. **Customer Segmentation:**  
   - Use churn predictions to cluster customers and develop personalized retention strategies.
3. **Continuous Model Improvement:**  
   - Regularly update the model with new data to capture evolving customer behavior.
4. **Temporal and Spatial Analysis:**  
   - Extend the analysis to track churn trends over time and explore geographic patterns in customer behavior.
